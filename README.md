# Hello World!
TEKConnect is a X-Plane Plugin, it's designed specially for VATEK, which is a Virtual Airline Software I will publish as soon.
TEKConnect will pump X-Plane's data, including aircraft position and status.
All the data will be pumped out to */Output/TEKConnect/TEKConnect_Query.dat*
and there will be a node-module for VATEK Software to read it in a formated way.
